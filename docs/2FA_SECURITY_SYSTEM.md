# 2FA Security Control System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Nexus Bank application now features a **secure 2FA control system** designed for scam baiting operations. This system ensures that only administrator-generated codes will allow login access, while all other codes (including random guesses) are rejected.

## Key Features

### üîê Admin-Controlled 2FA Codes
- **Only generated codes work**: All 2FA codes must be generated through the admin panel
- **Real TOTP algorithm**: Uses industry-standard Time-based One-Time Password generation
- **30-second expiry**: Codes expire after 30 seconds like real authenticators
- **One-time use**: Each code can only be used once to prevent replay attacks

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Behaviors
- **ALL invalid codes trigger lockouts**: Any code that isn't admin-generated is treated as suspicious
- **No blacklist needed**: Every wrong code is considered a potential attack
- **Faster lockouts**: 3 invalid attempts from ANY code will lock the account
- **Realistic behavior**: Maintains proper login flow and security responses

### üì± Admin Panel Integration
- **Live code display**: View all active 2FA codes for each user in real-time
- **Bulk generation**: Generate codes for all users with one click
- **Individual generation**: Create codes for specific users as needed
- **Emergency controls**: Force-expire all codes if needed

## How It Works

### For Scammers (External Users)
1. Scammer enters correct username/password
2. System shows 2FA prompt (looks normal)
3. Scammer tries ANY code (random, common patterns, guesses)
4. **ALL incorrect codes are rejected AND trigger lockout progression**
5. After 3 invalid attempts, account locks for 15 minutes
6. **No way to bypass without admin-generated code**

### For Admin (You)
1. Access admin panel at `/admin`
2. View "2FA Code Management" section
3. Generate codes as needed for testing or controlled access
4. Monitor which codes are active and when they expire
5. Control exactly when and if anyone can login

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. Start the application: `python run_app.py`
2. Access admin panel: `http://localhost:5000/admin`
3. Login with admin password (default: `admin123`)
4. Navigate to "üì± 2FA Code Management" section

### Generating 2FA Codes

#### For All Users
1. Click "üîê Generate New Codes for All Users"
2. New codes appear in the active codes section
3. Each user gets a fresh 30-second code

#### For Single User
1. Select user from dropdown in "Generate Code for Specific User"
2. Click "üéØ Generate Single Code"
3. Code appears in flash message and active codes section

#### Emergency Control
1. Click "‚ö†Ô∏è Expire All Active Codes" to immediately invalidate all codes
2. Useful if you need to quickly lock out all users

### Monitoring Active Codes
- **Real-time display**: See all currently valid codes
- **Expiry times**: Know exactly when each code expires
- **User methods**: See which 2FA method each user has (SMS/Email/App)
- **Statistics**: Track how many codes are active and generated daily

## Technical Implementation

### Code Generation
```python
# Real TOTP algorithm using HMAC-SHA1
code = totp_manager.generate_valid_code_for_user(username)
```

### Code Validation
```python
# Two possible results: valid or invalid_suspicious
# All invalid codes are treated as suspicious activity
is_valid, result = is_valid_totp_code(username, code)
```

### Admin Integration
- Codes are generated automatically when users reach 2FA step
- Admin can generate additional codes as needed
- All codes are tracked with expiry times and usage status

## Security Considerations

### Why This Works for Scam Baiting
1. **Looks legitimate**: 2FA prompt appears normal to scammers
2. **Aggressive security**: ANY wrong code is treated as suspicious activity
3. **Fast lockouts**: Only 3 attempts before 15-minute lockout
4. **Complete control**: You decide exactly when anyone can login
5. **Zero false positives**: No random codes will ever work by accident
6. **Realistic banking behavior**: Acts like a real high-security bank system

### Production Deployment Notes
- Change admin password via `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Codes are stored in memory (restart clears all codes)
- Consider database storage for persistent code history
- Monitor logs for attempted logins and failed codes

## Testing

Run the test script to verify security:
```bash
python test_2fa_security.py
```

Expected results:
- ‚úÖ Generated codes work once
- ‚úÖ ALL random codes are rejected as suspicious
- ‚úÖ Any invalid code triggers security lockout progression
- ‚úÖ Used codes cannot be reused

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Controlled Scammer Access
1. **Scammer contacts you**: Claims they need to "verify" your account
2. **You prepare**: Generate a 2FA code for the target user account
3. **You provide code**: Give scammer the working code (as if from your "phone")
4. **Scammer logs in**: They can now see the account with your planted transactions
5. **You monitor**: Watch their actions through the system
6. **You control**: Generate new codes only when you want them to access again

### Scenario: Complete Lockout
1. **Scammer becomes suspicious**: Starts testing random codes
2. **All codes fail**: Every attempt is rejected
3. **Realistic lockouts**: Account gets locked after too many attempts
4. **Natural behavior**: Appears as normal bank security, not artificial blocking

## Support Files Modified

### Core Files
- `src/bank/totp_manager.py` - New TOTP code generation and validation
- `src/bank/auth.py` - Enhanced with TOTP validation functions
- `src/bank/app.py` - Updated login flow and admin routes
- `src/bank/templates/admin.html` - Added 2FA management interface

### Test Files
- `test_2fa_security.py` - Comprehensive security validation

This system provides complete control over 2FA access while maintaining realistic banking security behavior for effective scam baiting operations.
