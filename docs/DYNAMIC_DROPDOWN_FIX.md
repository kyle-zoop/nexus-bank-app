# Dynamic Account Dropdown Fix

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ
The admin panel's manual transaction form showed **all possible account types** regardless of which user was selected, leading to:
- Confusion about which accounts users actually have
- Potential errors trying to add transactions to non-existent accounts
- Poor user experience with irrelevant options

## Root Cause üîç
Static HTML dropdown with hardcoded options:
```html
<option value="checking">Checking</option>
<option value="savings">Savings</option>
<option value="credit_card">Credit Card</option>
<option value="auto_loan">Auto Loan</option>
<option value="mortgage">Mortgage</option>
<option value="investment">Investment</option>
<option value="student_loan">Student Loan</option>
```

## Solution Implemented üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. JavaScript User-Account Mapping
```javascript
const userAccounts = {
    'vhamilton': [
        {value: 'checking', label: 'Executive Platinum Checking'},
        {value: 'savings', label: 'Private Wealth Savings'},
        {value: 'credit_card', label: 'Black Card - Unlimited'},
        {value: 'mortgage', label: 'Luxury Estate Mortgage'},
        {value: 'investment', label: 'Private Investment Portfolio'}
    ],
    // ... other users
};
```

### 2. Dynamic Dropdown Updates
- **Event Listener**: User dropdown change triggers account update
- **Real Account Names**: Shows proper account types (e.g., "Executive Platinum Checking")
- **Only Valid Options**: Only shows accounts the user actually has
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth transitions and color changes

### 3. Improved UX
- **Account dropdown disabled by default** until user selected
- **Helper text**: "Select a user first to see available accounts"
- **Visual transitions**: Smooth opacity and border color changes
- **Clear workflow**: Guides admin through proper selection order
