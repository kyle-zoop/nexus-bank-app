- Proof of address documents  
- Source of funds documentation
- Bank manager review process

### 2. Multi-Level Approval System
- Initial automated review (2-4 hours)
- Compliance officer review (24-48 hours)
- Bank manager final approval (2-3 business days)
- International transfer committee (for large amounts)

### 3. Additional Verification Steps
- Video call scheduling for large transfers
- In-person branch visit requirements
- Notarized authorization forms

### Implementation Files:
- `templates/wire_verification_enhanced.html` - Extended verification form

### Scam Baiting Benefits:
✅ **Maximum Time Waste** - Multiple steps over several days
✅ **Document Collection** - Gather scammer information
✅ **Frustration Factor** - Complex requirements discourage continuation
✅ **Realistic Experience** - Mirrors actual international banking compliance

This would transform a simple wire transfer into a multi-day, multi-step process that wastes significant scammer time while appearing completely legitimate.
