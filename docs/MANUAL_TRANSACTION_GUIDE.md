# Manual Transaction Control - Advanced Scam Baiting Tool

## Overview
This powerful new feature allows you to add custom transactions through the admin panel to counter and confuse scammers who try to edit the bank's source code or manipulate what victims see.

## The Problem
Scammers often:
- Edit HTML source code to show fake deposits/transfers
- Try to convince victims they've received money that doesn't exist
- Manipulate browser developer tools to create fake transactions
- Show "proof" of transfers that never happened

## The Solution: Real-Time Transaction Control
With the new admin panel feature, you can:
- **Add matching transactions** to make their fake edits "real"
- **Add counter-transactions** to create confusion and paranoia
- **Plant suspicious activities** to make them think they've been detected
- **Control the narrative** in real-time during scam calls

## How It Works

### Admin Panel Access
1. Navigate to `/admin` 
2. Enter admin password (`admin123` by default)
3. Scroll to "üí∞ Manual Transaction Control" section

### Adding Transactions
Choose from:
- **User**: Select any of the 5 identity profiles
- **Account**: Checking, Savings, Credit Card, etc.
- **Description**: Custom text (be creative!)
- **Amount**: Positive (deposit) or Negative (charge/fee)
- **Date**: Any date (defaults to today)
- **Type**: User Made, System Generated, or Scammer Bait

### Transaction Types
- **user_made**: Looks like the user did it (transfers, ATM withdrawals)
- **system_generated**: Looks automatic (interest, bills, deposits)
- **scammer_bait**: Special marking for tracking your interventions

## Psychological Warfare Tactics

**Counter**: Add the exact transaction through admin panel
**Result**: They think their fake edit "worked" but you control what happens next

### 2. Plant Suspicious Activities
```
‚ö†Ô∏è SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED - ACCOUNT FLAGGED    -$1,500
üö® MONEY LAUNDERING INVESTIGATION FEE                 -$2,500

üèÜ YOU'VE WON THE MEGA MILLIONS                       +$10,000,000
```

### 4. Administrative "Errors"
```

üîÑ DUPLICATE TRANSACTION REMOVED                      -$25,000

```

### 4. Documentation

## Advanced Usage

### API Integration
The `add_manual_transaction()` function can be called programmatically:
```python
add_manual_transaction(
    username='janderson47',
    account_name='checking', 
    description='üö® ACCOUNT UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION',
    amount=-5000.00,
    transaction_type='scammer_bait'
)
```

### Bulk Operations
Create multiple related transactions to build complex narratives:
```python
# Create an investigation sequence
transactions = [
    ("SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED", -500),
    ("FRAUD INVESTIGATION INITIATED", -1000), 
    ("FEDERAL HOLD PLACED", -10000),
    ("ACCOUNT FROZEN - CONTACT FBI", 0)
]
```

## Conclusion
This tool transforms your scam baiting from reactive to proactive. Instead of just wasting their time, you can actively manipulate their psychology, create panic, and make them question everything they think they know about banking systems.

**Remember**: The goal is to protect potential victims by keeping scammers busy, confused, and ultimately unsuccessful. Use this power responsibly and have fun watching them spiral into confusion! üé≠
